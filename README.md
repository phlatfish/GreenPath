## Introduction

GreenPath is an application that allows users to find eco-sustainable public transport near them, such as trains and buses. It aims to help aid the climate change crisis, which is constantly ongoing. By increasing public transport usage, and reducing carbon emissions released from excessive vehicles, GreenPath is working towards a cleaner planet in the future, while helping communities thrive and succeed.

## Our Purpose

GreenPath is designated to reduce greenhouse gases that come from transportation. In fact, according to the United States Environmental Protection Agency, "​Greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from transportation account for about 28 percent of total U.S. greenhouse gas emissions, making it the largest contributor of U.S. GHG emissions. Between 1990 and 2022, GHG emissions in the transportation sector increased more in absolute terms than any other sector." 

### Key Features

- Login to application.
- Input place of transit.
- Input preferred method of transportation.
- Showcase results, and public transport available near the user.
- Our data was imported from Deutsche Bahn, a train service in Germany.

## Getting Started


## Usage

Input your location, and where you want to go. Then, many public transportation options will appear for you, an alternative to less sustainable methods.

## Simplicity

GreenPath focuses on a simplistic web design, for maximum user experience, and a modern, sleek user interface. With reduced distractions, this effectively carries the purpose, motivation, and essence of GreenPath. According to Website Magazine, “Simple design makes it easy to draw the viewer's eye to the most important area of the page - and, if you're looking for conversions, that's your call to action. Navigating a cluttered interface is no fun. It can be confusing, overwhelming, and frustrating"(Lundin).

## Extensibility

We plan to further expand the potential of GreenPath, making it more diverse, widespread, and effective. In the future, we can input more data, to get a better comprehension of different locations, and the needs of people. Additionally, we can ask the user for their preferred form of transportation, and use this information to keep our experience consistent. Moreover, we can pursue more clean transportation methods, by partnering with electric vehicle companies to better GreenPath. We also plan to make GreenPath more applicable to our local NJ communities, by receiving data closer to use, instead of in Germany.

## Customization

Experienced developers may want to customize the project further. You can modify the code to change the appearance of the homepage, add additional features, or integrate it into other web applications.


GreenPath, the future of transportation!
