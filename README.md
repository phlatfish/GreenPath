GreenPath, the app that helps our users navigate to places they desire with eco-friendly transportation methods, including trains and buses. 

The climate crisis is ongoing, and commerce is one of the major aspects of sustainability. By helping our users input where they want to go, in a more public setting, we are helping reduce the spread of carbon emissions and move towards our goal of a clean planet.
